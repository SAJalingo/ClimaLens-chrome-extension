## Inspiration

As a **Sustainability Data Analyst** in energy and climate analytics, I frequently work with lengthy sustainability reports and research papers. Extracting insights manually is tedious and time-consuming.  
This motivated me to build **ClimaLens**, a browser extension that brings **AI-powered sustainability intelligence** directly to your tab.

## How It Works

ClimaLens integrates with **Google’s Built-in AI APIs** through **Chrome’s Manifest V3** environment.  
It uses the following APIs:

- **Summarizer API** – Generates concise summaries (metrics extraction, greenwashing detection, etc.).  
- **Popup UI** – Provides an interactive and intuitive interface for users.  

The extension processes the active webpage content, sends it to **Gemini AI**, and returns structured insights directly inside the extension interface.
